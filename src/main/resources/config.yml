  # Custom function arguments ("/repair <function>"):
  # - INFO >> This configuration is used to bind custom command arguments ("/repair <argument>") to functions. For
  #           example, specifying "inv" in the list for inventory repair will cause "/repair inv" to repair one's inventory.
  # - IMPORTANT >> One argument can only be assigned to one function (you cannot bind one argument to multiple functions).

#             ...
#           You can specify type, name, lore, enchantments, flags and unbreakable state for each item. The example below
#           shows how all these attributes can be specified.
#           An item is considered blocked if all attributes specified here match the ones of the item. That means
#           specifying lore as an empty array also requires the item not to have any lore in order to be blocked; if
#           omitted, lore is not compared.

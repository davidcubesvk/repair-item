# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
command:
  # Function argument (1st):
  # - Info: This configuration is used to bind specific command arguments ("/repair ARGUMENT") to functions. For
  #         example, specifying "inv" in the list for inventory repair will bind the argument to this function. That
  #         means, if a player uses "/repair inv", the inventory will be repaired.
  # - Note: Please note that one argument can be assigned to only one function, e.g. if you specify "inv" in inventory
  #         repair, you can not specify (bind) it to armor repair, too.

#           [attribute: value]
#           ...
#         You can specify type, name, lore, enchantments, flags and unbreakable state for each item.

#         no enchantments and no flags, with unbreakable state set to false, will be blocked. Please look at the wiki
#         for more information.
